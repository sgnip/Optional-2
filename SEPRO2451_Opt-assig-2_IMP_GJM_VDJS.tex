\section{Problem 1}

\subsection{Random brainstorming to answer}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Meet and get to know as much as possible people I'm gonna work with, so we can work together being more productive.

	\item Monitor:
	\subitem	Expenses.
	\subitem Timing plan.
	\subitem Performed effort.
	\subitem Consumed resources.
	\subitem Technical	activities.
	\subitem Results.
	\subitem Risks.
	\subitem Unsolved conflicts or problematic aspects.
	\item Selection of standards, methods, procedures
	\item Risks identification and contingency plans.
	\item Identification of reusable ‘products’/similar projects.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Priorized task}
What is Milestones definition.¿?


\begin{enumerate}
\item Identification of reusable ‘products’/similar projects.
\item Selection of methodology to work with. It may be interesting to take into account possible feedback to TAKEOFF Ltd.
\item Selection of standards, methods, procedures, so everybody can start working on the project. If there is some similar project, we should choose technology depending on that.

If it's not done yet allocating responsibilities and activities.
(We guess it's, because before analyzing requirements, the person in charge of analysis must be already allocated with it's responsibility and it's activity)\item Meet and get to know as much as possible people I'm gonna work with, so we can work together being more productive.
\subitem 3.1 Assign roles to people in the team (if it's not done yet).
\item Risks identification and contingency plans. Now developers and programmers are working, we can define contingency plans for risks after we identify them.
\item Monitor software quality, technical results to assure the software won't fail.
\item Monitor timing plan trying to assure it's not delayed. This is not so important as quality because we have 4 months of acceptable delay.
\item Product and process review and give feedback to TAKEOFF Ltd. if needed.

\end{enumerate}
