\section{Problem 1}

We have defined the important tasks to be done in the order we think is the proper one.

\subsection{Priorized task}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identification of reusable ‘products’/similar projects. \textit{This is important because we can reuse software (analysis, designs, coding and its documentation) since the beginning of the project. If we wait too much to search for reusable similar projects,  we may have started working in some module, and that work would be useless if we have already done some very similar work before.}



\item Selection of standards, methods, procedures, so everybody can start working on the project. We should select the methodology to work with (if it is not already done). It is interesting to take into account possible feedback to TAKEOFF Ltd. If there is some similar project, we could choose technology and/or methodology depending on that.


\item Meet and get to know as much as possible people we're going to work with, so we can work together being more productive. \textit{Team management is a really important task to be done the best we can}
\subitem 3.1 If it's not done yet, we would allocate responsibilities and activities.
\textit{We guess it is done, because before analyzing requirements, the person in charge of analysis must be already allocated with it's responsibility and it's activity, but maybe the development teams are not properly formed.}

\item Risks identification and contingency plans. \textit{Now people in the project are working, we can define contingency plans for risks after we identify them, so we can be prepared to solve problems that come from those risks.}

\item Monitor software quality, technical results to assure the software won't fail. \textit{After we finish the design we would start to make the test plan, being as exhaustive as possible so we assure the software won't fail.}

\item Monitor timing plan trying to assure it's not delayed. This is not so important as quality because we have 4 months of acceptable delay. \textit{We are more focused on software quality because it is more important. We have plan to spend $x$ months in this project and we can have 4 months on delay, so we should encourage the software quality more than timing.}


\item Product and process review and give feedback to TAKEOFF Ltd. if needed \textit{TAKEOFF Ltd. may be interested in having some feedback. If this is the case, we have to take this into account but feedback it is not more important than the software's quality nor than the timing plan.}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem 2}

\paragraph{Applying a variant of the field observation technique to the set film, list the reasons why your business might fail. What measures would you take to prevent each of the mistakes from causing your business to fail?}
\paragraph{}

This is the list of possible mistakes that can cause some business to fail and how can we prevent ourselves from them.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Lack of business strategy and being too optimistic \textit{Get someone from the outside the project to help with business strategy and estimation, so we keep being realistic}.
	\item Tension inside the team \textit{We shouldn't care too much from the project instead of the team. We should take into account how are we behaving with people in the team and we should treat them properly.}
	\item Lack of senior executives increased because of no previous failures. \textit{We can't do anything about not having previous failures, but we can get someone from the outside so we could get helped.}
	\item No competitors analysis. \textit{It is very important to look around in the business field and watch out for competitors. One should not work in something that is already being done and works good enough.}
	\item No ability to keep up with technology to take care of mass problem (website). \textit{Every enterprise, even more technologies ones, must keep on learning how technology is evolving so they can adapt their selves to the new systems.}
	\item Too rapid grow with no experience neither exhaustive plan to control it.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Shifting the focus of the film to software project definition and start-up, what problems might arise and how could they be solved if the customer, developer and user are all the same person and if they are different people? What are the potential advantages of the customer, developer and user being the same person?}
\paragraph{}


The biggest advantage given by  customer and developer being the same person is the impossibility of lack of communication. One should know exactly what he wants, so the requirements are clear from the very beginning.

The same happens if the developer and the user are the same person. 

Even easier communication would be if customer and user are also the same person. What the user needs is exactly what the customer would want to to be developed.

In summary, the so normal communication problem would not exist at all if the developer, client and customer are the same person.

\paragraph{What qualities should or must a project leader have?}
\paragraph{}
The first of all, being \textbf{communicative}. Being able to demand the amount of work necessary to the workers, without make them slaves. A project leader should know the workers he works with to be able to demand work properly.

A project leader must know some technical stuff involved in the project for a better comprehension of it and for a better understanding of problems that may arise.

Another important quality is knowing how to solve problems among the workers (similar to being communicative).


\paragraph{What project management and leadership activities are performed in Startup.com?}
\paragraph{}

In Startup.com is performed a greedy aim to earn money and get clients. It is also performed a poor execution of plans. The leaders performed a very poor example to the workers because of the tension between the founders. If not even founders and chiefs can work together, we can't expect workers to work good enough.

\paragraph{List the steps to be taken to define and start up a software project}
\paragraph{}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Have a great idea.
	\item Check it is possible and nobody else has done it.
	\subitem if that idea exists, think how to improve it and if it's necessary.
	\item Get a small great team.
	\item Do a exhaustive viability study to see if it is possible to start up the project and if it will be worthwhile.
	\item Get an office and some investors who can help you with first period of businesses where no money is earned.
	\item Start working, in developing (not just coding, analysis and design is developing too) and in commercial labors: someone will need to buy what you are doing so the businesses makes money. Even if the project is just some software someone has asked us to do, we need to do commercial labors talking to the hirer who hired us.
	\item Know how to deal with fast growing. Know how to let others do the job so chiefs don't have to be in charge of everything.
	\item Now you have made a great businesses, you can keep working and earning money.
\end{enumerate}
